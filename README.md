#### By **Jocine Nabwire, Ted Odote, Tonia Chebet, Daisy Lynn Wanjiru, Lee Ngugi, John Maronga**
## Description
A repository containing a detailed analysis of the Missing migrants done using python.
## Business problem
Every year, hundreds of thousands of people leave their homes in search of a better life. In the process, many are injured or killed thus IOM came up with the Missing Migrants Project to track deaths of migrants and those who have gone missing along migratory routes across the globe. This enables them to identify ways of curbing death among migrants and understand the background of those who are most at risk to lose their life during migration.
## Objectives

To find the leading cause of death and the factors that may add/influence it
## Research Questions
1.What was the leading cause of death?

2.Which migrantâ€™s region of origin had the highest deaths?

3.Which migrant's region of origin had the highest missing people?

4 What was the most affected nationality?

5.Which incident region had the highest number of dead people?

6.Which incident region had the highest number of missing people?

## Setup/Installation Requirements
